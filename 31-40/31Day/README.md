# Write a Program to Find the Factorial of a Number

The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number. 

For example,
- factorial of 5 is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.

The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
- factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4.....n The factorial of negative numbers do not exist and the factorial of 0 is 1.

## Test Case
- factorial(2) is 2
- factorial(5) is 120
- factorial(10) is 3628800
